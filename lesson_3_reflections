When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people or to backup material.  Also, to share publicly.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not want the changes other people made.  Also may need to merge branches.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: from GitHub to GitHub, allows traceability back to original creator
Clones: from Github to local or local to local, does not allow traceability
Branches: allows different changes locally
