When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people or to backup material.  Also, to share publicly.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not want the changes other people made.  Also may need to merge branches.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: from GitHub to GitHub, allows traceability back to original creator
Clones: from Github to local or local to local, does not allow traceability
Branches: allows different changes locally

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work on it locally and make changes offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Shard network drive.  Would need to keep revisions smartly named. Would not need to remember git commands, but harder to 
make sure only one person changing things at a time.
